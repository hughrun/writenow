Contributions are very welcome. Keep in mind that this is something I'm maintaining in my spare time, and I'm not a professional software developer - you may have to wait a day or two to get a response.

# Code

Before submitting a merge request, please log an **issue** first.

# Documentation

Contributions to the documentation, or suggestions for anything that's missing, are _especially_ welcome.

# Suggestions

Suggestions for new/improved features are welcome! Please check **issues** to see if your suggestion already exists, and if it does, 'upvote' it with a thumbs up.

# Bug reports

I hate to sound repetitive, but if you find a bug ...log an issue. But check existing issues first in case it is already listed. If you think it might be a security bug, please do **not** log an issue - [send an email](mailt:DO_NOT_SPAM_ME_hugh@hughrundle.net) instead and I'll try to get it fixed ASAP.
